## About

Kladderadatsch is a mood based task tracking app for people trying to build long term routines in their life, but struggling with the lack of energy.
We are focusing on getting you started in a few clicks, instead of investing lots of mental resources in a complicated sign up and set up process.

By starting the App for the first time, you will have a basic set up, which is designed for people dealing with depression, that can be adjusted later, or on the go.
Depending on your current mood, the app will select a set of housekeeping, hygiene, responsibility or self-care task for you to focus on.
To safe users from overstress by watching a huge to do list, we only show a mood and energy based selection, but prioritize unfinished or not shown task in the background, so they do not get lost in and after low energy periods.
We hope that by using this app, people can invest their already scarce vitality and liveliness on their well-beeing, instead of worrying and feeling stressed about their daily life.

We believe this sensitive mood and task data is yours only.
Privacy is one of our main goals. Your data lives and stays on your device and can only be exported and shared by yourself.
