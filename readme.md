# Kladderadatsch - Mok din shiet!

> Guided Self Help for People with Depression

## About

Kladderadatsch is a mood based task tracking app for people trying to build long term routines in their life. Privacy is one of our main goals. Your data lives and stays on your device.

The idea and an initial mockup were first developed at #HealthHackKiel 2018. You can read more about the [initial goals and the envisioned use cases in our original abstract](./docs/healthhackkiel.md).

You can follow our progress in developing a fully usable prototype by looking at our [project roadmap](https://github.com/chaostreff-flensburg/kladderadatsch/projects/1). We will provide a hosted version to try the app for yourself soon.

## Deployment

### As a node.js Project

Clone the repo and follow the build instructions under [Build Setup](#build-setup).
A node.js version of `10.4` or higher is needed. Older versions may work, but are not tested.

## Development

Pushing to main is restricted. Please work in a `feature/` or `bug/` branch and create a pull request. Merging requires the CI passing, an approved review and the branch being up to date.

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

### Code Style

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format code. Prettier should be run before creating a pull request. You can run it with the default settings from your editor. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://prettier.io).
