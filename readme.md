# Kladderadatsch - Mok din shiet!

> Guided Self Help for People with Depression

## About

Kladderadatsch is a mood based task tracking app for people trying to build long term routines in their life, but struggling with the lack of energy.
We are focusing on getting you started in a few clicks, instead of investing lots of mental resources in a complicated sign up and set up process.

By starting the App for the first time, you will have a basic set up, which is designed for people dealing with depression, that can be adjusted later, or on the go.
Depending on your current mood, the app will select a set of housekeeping, hygiene, responsibility or self-care task for you to focus on. 
To safe users from overstress by watching a huge to do list, we only show a mood and energy based selection, but prioritize unfinished or not shown task in the background, so they do not get lost in and after low energy periods.
We hope that by using this app, people can invest their already scarce vitality and liveliness on their well-beeing, instead of worrying and feeling stressed about their daily life.

We believe this sensitive mood and task data is yours only.
Privacy is one of our main goals. Your data lives and stays on your device and can only be exported and shared by yourself.

The idea and an initial mockup were first developed at #HealthHackKiel 2018. You can read more about the [initial goals and the envisioned use cases in our original abstract](./docs/healthhackkiel.md).

You can follow our progress in developing a fully usable prototype by looking at our [project roadmap](https://github.com/chaostreff-flensburg/kladderadatsch/projects/1).

## Deployment

### As a node.js Project

Clone the repo and follow the build instructions under [Build Setup](#build-setup).
A node.js version of `14` or higher is needed. Older versions may work (next.js 10 supports >= 10.13.0), but are not tested.

## Development

Please work in a `feature/` or `bug/` branch and create a pull request. Merging requires the CI passing and the branch being up to date.

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

### Code Style

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format code. Prettier should be run before creating a pull request. You can run it with the default settings from your editor. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://prettier.io).
